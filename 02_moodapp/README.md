# Springboard 44.1 Exercise - Mood App

In this exercise, you will build a mood changer app that uses redux to alter the mood of a text emoji  

Remember that since you are using Redux, your reducer must be a pure function. Your actions should include a payload with the new face.  

For DOM manipulation you can use raw JavaScript or JQuery. Redux has been provided for you in a script tag within the starter code.  

Do not build this application using React - this should strictly be done with Redux
